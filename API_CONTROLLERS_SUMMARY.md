# TeamStride API Controllers Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the API controllers that have been implemented for the TeamStride team management platform.

## Implemented Controllers

### 1. TeamManagementController (`/api/teammanagement`)
**Purpose**: Core team management operations including CRUD, subdomain management, and tier limits.

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/teammanagement` - Get paginated list of teams (Global Admin only)
- `GET /api/teammanagement/{teamId}` - Get team by ID
- `GET /api/teammanagement/subdomain/{subdomain}` - Get team by subdomain
- `POST /api/teammanagement` - Create new team (Global Admin only)
- `PUT /api/teammanagement/{teamId}` - Update team
- `DELETE /api/teammanagement/{teamId}` - Delete team (soft delete)
- `GET /api/teammanagement/subdomain/{subdomain}/availability` - Check subdomain availability
- `PUT /api/teammanagement/{teamId}/subdomain` - Update team subdomain (Global Admin only)
- `GET /api/teammanagement/tiers/{tier}/limits` - Get tier limits
- `GET /api/teammanagement/{teamId}/can-add-athlete` - Check if team can add more athletes

### 2. OwnershipTransferController (`/api/ownershiptransfer`)
**Purpose**: Team ownership transfer operations.

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/ownershiptransfer/teams/{teamId}/transfer` - Initiate ownership transfer
- `POST /api/ownershiptransfer/complete/{transferToken}` - Complete ownership transfer (Anonymous)
- `DELETE /api/ownershiptransfer/{transferId}` - Cancel ownership transfer
- `GET /api/ownershiptransfer/teams/{teamId}/pending` - Get pending transfers for team

### 3. TeamSubscriptionController (`/api/teamsubscription`)
**Purpose**: Team subscription and branding management.

**Endpoints**:
- `PUT /api/teamsubscription/teams/{teamId}/subscription` - Update team subscription
- `PUT /api/teamsubscription/teams/{teamId}/branding` - Update team branding

### 4. TeamMembersController (`/api/teammembers`)
**Purpose**: Team member management operations.

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/teammembers/teams/{teamId}/members` - Get paginated list of team members
- `PUT /api/teammembers/teams/{teamId}/members/{userId}/role` - Update member role
- `DELETE /api/teammembers/teams/{teamId}/members/{userId}` - Remove member from team

## Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require authentication except ownership transfer completion
- Role-based access control (Global Admin, Team Owner, Team Admin, etc.)
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- `TeamManagementDto` - Complete team information with statistics
- `CreateTeamDto` - Team creation data
- `UpdateTeamDto` - Team update data
- `TransferOwnershipDto` - Ownership transfer details
- `UpdateSubscriptionDto` - Subscription update data
- `UpdateTeamBrandingDto` - Branding update data
- `TeamMemberDto` - Team member information
- `OwnershipTransferDto` - Transfer status and details
- `TeamTierLimitsDto` - Tier limitations and features

### Error Handling
- Consistent error responses with trace IDs
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Detailed error messages for validation failures
- Exception handling middleware integration

### Validation
- Model validation using Data Annotations
- Custom validation for business rules
- Subdomain format validation
- Color code validation for branding

### Pagination
- Built-in pagination support for list endpoints
- Configurable page size and number
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Service Integration

All controllers integrate with the `ITeamManagementService` which provides:
- Team CRUD operations
- Ownership transfer management
- Subscription and branding updates
- Member management
- Authorization checks
- Tier limit validation

## Testing

Basic integration tests have been created to verify:
- Controller endpoints are accessible
- Authentication requirements are enforced
- Proper HTTP status codes are returned
- Error handling works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication Integration**: Implement JWT token authentication in tests
2. **Advanced Testing**: Add authenticated test scenarios
3. **API Documentation**: Enhance Swagger documentation with examples
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
5. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
6. **Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics collection

## Architecture Notes

The controllers follow clean architecture principles:
- Controllers handle HTTP concerns only
- Business logic is in the service layer
- Data access is abstracted through repositories
- DTOs provide clear API contracts
- Proper separation of concerns throughout

All controllers inherit from `BaseApiController` which provides:
- Consistent error handling
- Logging integration
- Common HTTP response helpers
- Trace ID generation for debugging
